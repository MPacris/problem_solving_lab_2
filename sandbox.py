#Task 1: Reverse a String
#HINT: Review the Algorithms + Problem Solving Lecture!)
#Write code that takes a string as input and returns the string reversed
#i.e. “Hello” will be returned as “olleH

def reverse_word(word):
    reversed_word = ""     
    last_index = len(word) - 1
    for index in range(last_index, -1, -1):
        reversed_word += word[index]
        
    print(reversed_word)

word = input('provide a word')
    
reversed_word = reverse_word(word)






#Task 2: Capitalize a Letter
#Write code that takes a string as input and capitalize the first letter of each word. Words will be separated by only one space. i.e. “hello world” should be outputted as “Hello World



#Task 3: Palindrome
#A “palindrome” is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward i.e. madam	
#Write code that takes a user input and checks to see if it is a Palindrome and reports the result


#Bonus Challenge
#Task 4 : Compress a string of characters
#For example, an input of "aaabbbbbccccaacccbbbaaabbbaaa" would compress to "3a5b4c2a3c3b3a3b3a"
